## About Me
Hi all, I'm a second year MURP student studying transportation with side interests in enviornmental and housing issues. I was born and raised in Montana but have also lived in Ohio and NYC. My academic and professional background is similarly all over the place (Music :arrow_right: Theater :arrow_right: Math Education :arrow_right: Non-Profit Program Managment). I have had a decent amount of previous experience with Python and GIS but would love to get more practice putting the two together and explore some new methods and research questions!

## Project Interests
- Transit Oriented Development and Gentrification
- Land Use impacts on Travel Behavior

I'm open to new ideas too :smile:	

## Objectives for the Course
To practice python, explore some more open source mapping tools and techniques and expand my portfolio of research
